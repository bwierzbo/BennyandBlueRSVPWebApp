# Task: Testing & Performance Optimization

## Description
Comprehensive testing and performance optimization of the admin interface to ensure production readiness. This task validates functionality, optimizes performance, and handles edge cases to meet all success criteria before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manual testing of admin interface with real RSVP data
- [ ] Performance testing meets <2 second page load requirement
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive testing on major browsers
- [ ] Edge case testing (empty state, large guest lists, special characters)
- [ ] Error handling validation for database connection issues
- [ ] Database query performance optimization (<500ms)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- [ ] Production deployment testing

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Manual testing with existing RSVP submissions
  - Performance profiling and optimization
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Error scenario testing and handling
  - Database query performance analysis
  - Mobile device testing for responsive design
  - Production build validation
- **Key considerations**:
  - Test with realistic data volumes
  - Validate performance under different network conditions
  - Ensure error states are handled gracefully
  - Check for edge cases with guest names and special characters
  - Verify mobile usability on various screen sizes
  - Performance optimization without compromising functionality
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - Admin page components (optimization only)
  - Database query functions (optimization if needed)
  - Error handling enhancements

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (UI components and styling)
- [ ] Real RSVP data in database for testing
- [ ] Production environment for deployment testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (final validation step)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All functionality tested and working correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met consistently
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated
- [ ] Error handling working properly
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
