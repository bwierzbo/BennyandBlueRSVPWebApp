# Task: Admin Page Implementation

## Description
Build the `/admin/guests` server component page that displays all RSVP submissions with comprehensive guest information. This task creates the core admin interface using Next.js App Router server components for optimal performance and immediate content visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/admin/guests` route created using Next.js App Router
- [ ] Server-side rendered page with RSVP data display
- [ ] All RSVP information shown per entry (name, email, attendance, guests, notes, timestamp)
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between attending and non-attending guests
- [ ] Submission timestamp formatted for readability
- [ ] Guest names properly displayed when available
- [ ] Basic responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- [ ] Page loads under 2 seconds consistently

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Create `app/admin/guests/page.tsx` as Next.js server component
  - Integrate with database query functions from Task 12
  - Server-side data processing and formatting
  - Basic HTML structure with semantic markup
  - Comment placeholders for future authentication middleware
- **Key considerations**:
  - Server-side rendering for immediate content visibility
  - Efficient data fetching on page load
  - Proper error handling for database connection issues
  - Guest privacy considerations with URL obscurity
  - SEO-friendly structure even though it's an admin page
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `app/admin/guests/page.tsx` - Main admin page server component
  - Create admin directory structure in app router

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 12 completed (database query enhancement)
- [ ] Existing Next.js App Router setup
- [ ] Database utilities available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on database functions)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Admin page accessible at `/admin/guests`
- [ ] All RSVP data accurately displayed
- [ ] Server-side rendering functioning correctly
- [ ] Basic responsive layout implemented
- [ ] Error handling for database issues
- [ ] Page performance under 2 seconds
- [ ] Authentication placeholders added with comments
