- **Category**: Frontend
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days
- **Dependencies**: 001-foundation-setup

## Objective
Transform the landing page (`/app/page.tsx`) to use the new wedding color palette established in the foundation task, creating a cohesive and elegant visual experience that reflects the romantic wedding theme.

## Files to Modify

- Components may need updates for consistency with new palette

## Technical Requirements
- Apply dusty pink (#D4A574) as primary accent color for CTA buttons
- Use sage green (#8FA68E) for secondary elements and accents
- Implement warm cream (#F5F1E8) backgrounds where appropriate
- Maintain charcoal (#2C3E50) for primary text with good contrast
- Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG accessibility standards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hero section uses new wedding color palette consistently
- [ ] Wedding details cards styled with cohesive color scheme
- [ ] CTA buttons use dusty pink primary colors with proper hover states
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained across all breakpoints
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (navigation, interactions)
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Visual hierarchy enhanced through strategic color application

## Design Considerations
- Hero section should feel warm and inviting with the cream background
- Wedding details cards should have subtle sage green accents
- Primary CTA should use dusty pink to draw attention
- Secondary elements can use muted tones from the palette
- Ensure the color scheme creates a romantic, elegant atmosphere

## Testing Requirements
- Verify responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Test color contrast for accessibility compliance
- Validate that all interactive elements maintain visual feedback
- Ensure consistent styling across different browsers

## Notes
This task builds upon the foundation color variables established in task 001. The landing page serves as the primary entry point and should showcase the wedding theme effectively while maintaining professional polish and accessibility standards.
