# Foundation Setup: TailwindCSS Configuration and Base Styles

## Description

Enhance TailwindCSS configuration with wedding color palette (dusty pink, rose gold, lavender) and update base styles in globals.css. This task establishes the foundational styling configuration that will be used throughout the wedding RSVP application.

## Background

The current TailwindCSS configuration is minimal with only basic gradient utilities. The globals.css file contains default Next.js styling with dark mode support. We need to establish a cohesive wedding theme with custom colors and typography that reflects the romantic, elegant nature of a wedding application.

## Files to Modify

### `/tailwind.config.js`
- Add wedding color extensions with multiple shades
- Configure Inter font family
- Ensure existing functionality is preserved

### `/app/globals.css`
- Update base styles with Inter font stack
- Refine typography hierarchy
- Maintain existing dark mode support while preparing for wedding theme

## Technical Requirements

### Color Palette Implementation
```javascript
// Colors should be accessible as:
// - wedding-dustyPink-{50,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900}
// - wedding-roseGold-{50,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900}
// - wedding-lavender-{50,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900}
```

### Font Configuration
- Inter font family as primary typeface
- Fallback to system fonts
- Maintain existing responsive design principles

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom wedding colors accessible as `wedding-dustyPink-*`, `wedding-roseGold-*`, `wedding-lavender-*`
- [ ] Color shades include full spectrum (50-900) for design flexibility
- [ ] Inter font family configured in TailwindCSS with proper fallbacks
- [ ] Base styles updated with improved typography hierarchy
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (gradients, responsive design)
- [ ] Build process validates without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] No ESLint errors introduced (`npm run lint`)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Color Selection**: Use standard Tailwind color shade methodology for consistency
2. **Font Loading**: Ensure Inter font is properly loaded via Next.js font optimization
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing gradient utilities and color variables
4. **Performance**: Avoid introducing unnecessary CSS bloat

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Colors render correctly in browser
- [ ] Font loads properly on first page load
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Existing components maintain their appearance
- [ ] Build output is clean and optimized

## Dependencies

None - This is a foundational task that other styling tasks will depend on.
