# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize form performance, database queries, and user experience to meet all performance benchmarks. Focus on dynamic field rendering, form submission speed, and overall responsiveness while maintaining functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dynamic field rendering meets <100ms target
- [ ] Form submission processing under 2 seconds
- [ ] Database operations optimized for guest data
- [ ] Page load performance maintains Lighthouse >90 scores
- [ ] Mobile performance optimized for slower devices
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for dynamic form state
- [ ] No performance regressions from baseline

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Profile and optimize dynamic guest field rendering
  - Optimize database queries for guest names storage/retrieval
  - Implement performance monitoring and measurement
  - Optimize React re-renders and state management
  - Review and optimize bundle size impact
- **Key considerations**:
  - Focus on perceived performance for user experience
  - Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
  - Consider lazy loading for guest fields if beneficial
  - Minimize JavaScript bundle size impact
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - Form components (optimization only)
  - Database utilities (query optimization)
  - Performance monitoring setup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 completed (integration testing to establish baseline)
- [ ] All functionality implemented and working correctly

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: false (final optimization and polish)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met consistently
- [ ] Dynamic field rendering optimized and smooth
- [ ] Form submission meets performance targets
- [ ] Database queries optimized for guest operations
- [ ] No functionality regressions from optimizations
- [ ] Performance monitoring in place for production
