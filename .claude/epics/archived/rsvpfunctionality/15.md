# Task: Integration Testing

## Description
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete RSVP flow with guest management, including manual testing, edge case validation, and performance verification. Ensure all user scenarios work correctly before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete user flow testing for attending guests with 0-10 guests
- [ ] Complete user flow testing for non-attending guests
- [ ] Edge case testing (maximum guests, validation errors, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing (mobile and desktop)
- [ ] Performance testing meets all benchmarks
- [ ] Database integrity verification with guest data
- [ ] Progressive enhancement testing without JavaScript

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Manual testing of all user scenarios and edge cases
  - Performance testing for dynamic field rendering and form submission
  - Database testing to verify guest names storage and retrieval
  - Cross-browser testing on major browsers and devices
  - Error scenario testing with invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Key considerations**:
  - Test both happy path and error scenarios thoroughly
  - Verify performance benchmarks are met consistently
  - Ensure guest data is correctly stored and can be retrieved
  - Test form works properly with and without JavaScript
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - All form components and Server Actions (testing only)
  - Database utilities and schema (verification)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (dynamic RSVP form implementation)
- [ ] Task 004 completed (Server Actions enhancement)
- [ ] Database environment available for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (requires complete implementation for testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user flows tested and verified working
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully with proper error messages
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for all scenarios
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Database operations verified with sample guest data
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
