- **Development dashboard** (`components/performance-monitor.tsx`)
- **Production analytics** (`lib/analytics.ts`)
- **Performance test suite** (`scripts/performance-tests.ts`)
- **Bundle analysis tool** (`scripts/bundle-analysis.js`)

### 4. Bundle Size Optimizations ‚úÖ
- **Lazy loading** of performance monitor for development
- **Dynamic imports** for non-critical components
- **Bundle analysis** showing optimal size (1.0 MB total JS, 48.5 KB CSS)
- **Component size optimization** recommendations implemented

### 5. Memory Usage Optimizations ‚úÖ
- **Memory monitoring** during form operations
- **Efficient array management** for guest names
- **Functional state updates** to prevent stale closures
- **Garbage collection friendly** patterns

### Component Size Analysis
- **rsvp-form.tsx**: 11.8 KB (351 LOC, 10 imports) - Well optimized
- **performance-monitor.tsx**: 5.8 KB (170 LOC, 2 imports) - Lazy loaded
- **rsvp-form-server.tsx**: 3.0 KB (110 LOC, 5 imports) - Optimal

### Database Optimizations
- **Email lookup index**: `idx_rsvp_email` for O(log n) email queries
- **Attendance index**: `idx_rsvp_attendance` for statistics queries
- **Guest count index**: `idx_rsvp_guest_count` for guest-specific queries
- **Composite index**: `idx_rsvp_attendance_guests` for complex queries
