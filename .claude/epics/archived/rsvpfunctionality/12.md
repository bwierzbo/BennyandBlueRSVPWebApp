# Task: Form Validation Extension

## Description
Enhance existing Zod validation schemas and TypeScript interfaces to support dynamic guest name validation. Extend the current form validation system to handle 0-10 guest names with appropriate validation rules and error messaging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zod schema updated to include guest names array validation
- [ ] Guest count validation (0-10 maximum)
- [ ] Individual guest name validation (required when guest count > 0)
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces updated for form data with guests
- [ ] Client-side validation integrated with React Hook Form
- [ ] Server-side validation schemas match client-side rules
- [ ] Error messages are clear and user-friendly for guest scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Extend existing validation schemas in `lib/validations.ts`
  - Add guest-specific validation rules and error messages
  - Update form TypeScript interfaces for guest names array
  - Enhance error message utilities for guest-related validation
- **Key considerations**:
  - Guest names are required only when numberOfGuests > 0
  - Maximum 10 guests allowed per RSVP
  - Each guest name must be non-empty when provided
  - Validation should work both client-side and server-side
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `lib/validations.ts` - Zod schema extensions
  - `lib/error-messages.ts` - Guest-specific error messages
  - `types/index.ts` - Form data interfaces with guest names

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (database schema with guest names support)
- [ ] Existing validation system from webappframework epic
- [ ] React Hook Form and Zod packages available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside dynamic form implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Validation schemas handle guest names array correctly
- [ ] Guest count validation enforces 0-10 limit
- [ ] Guest name requirements work conditionally
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful with new interfaces
- [ ] Error messages are informative and actionable
- [ ] Validation works consistently on client and server
