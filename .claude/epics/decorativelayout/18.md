- [ ] PageBanner component created (`components/ui/page-banner.tsx`)
- [ ] ImageSection component created (`components/ui/image-section.tsx`)
- [ ] All components use Next.js Image with proper optimization
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for component props
- [ ] Error handling and fallback images implemented
- [ ] Responsive design with Tailwind CSS classes

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 days

- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] Components responsive on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Error handling tested with missing images
- [ ] Performance optimized (proper loading priorities)
- [ ] Ready for page integration
