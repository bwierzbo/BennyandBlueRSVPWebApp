# Epic: decorativelayout

## Overview

Transform the wedding RSVP application into a visually appealing wedding invitation experience by adding strategic decorative images to existing pages. This implementation leverages Next.js Image optimization and existing Tailwind CSS styling to minimize code changes while maximizing visual impact.

## Architecture Decisions

**Leverage Existing Infrastructure**
- Use Next.js 14+ Image component (already available) for automatic optimization
- Extend existing Tailwind CSS classes rather than creating new design system
- Build on current component structure without major refactoring

**Minimalist Approach**
- Create only 2-3 reusable image components to avoid over-engineering
- Use direct image placement on existing pages rather than complex layout changes
- Prioritize placeholder images to avoid external dependencies

**Performance First**
- Implement Next.js Image with priority loading for above-the-fold content
- Use lazy loading for decorative elements
- Leverage existing Vercel hosting for automatic WebP conversion

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Reusable Image Components (3 total)**
```typescript
// Simple, focused components
<HeroImage />      // Landing page hero with text overlay
<PageBanner />     // Decorative headers for pages
<ImageSection />   // Flexible image + text combinations
```

**Page Enhancements**
- `/` (Landing): Add hero image with wedding announcement overlay
- `/rsvp` (Form): Add decorative banner, maintain existing form functionality
- `/thank-you` (Confirmation): Add thank-you image with existing messaging

**State Management**
- No additional state management needed
- Use existing Next.js static optimization
- Leverage current Tailwind responsive utilities

### Backend Services

**No Backend Changes Required**
- All images served statically from `public/images/`
- No API modifications needed
- No database schema changes
- Maintain existing RSVP functionality

### Infrastructure

**Asset Management**
- Store optimized images in `public/images/` directory structure
- Use Next.js automatic image optimization (no additional CDN setup)
- Leverage existing Vercel deployment pipeline

**Performance Monitoring**
- Use existing build process to monitor bundle size impact
- Test Core Web Vitals with current monitoring setup
- No additional infrastructure required

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Asset Setup & Components (Week 1)**
- Source and optimize placeholder images
- Create 3 core image components
- Implement image error handling and fallbacks

**Phase 2: Page Integration (Week 1)**
- Integrate hero image on landing page
- Add decorative elements to RSVP page
- Enhance thank-you page with imagery

**Risk Mitigation**
- Start with small, optimized images to test performance impact
- Implement graceful degradation for missing images
- Use existing error boundary patterns from current app

**Testing Approach**
- Manual testing across existing device/browser matrix
- Use current lighthouse setup for performance validation
- Test image loading on slow connections

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Asset Collection & Optimization**: Source placeholder images, optimize for web delivery
- [ ] **Core Image Components**: Build HeroImage, PageBanner, ImageSection components
- [ ] **Landing Page Enhancement**: Integrate hero image with text overlay
- [ ] **RSVP Page Enhancement**: Add decorative banner without disrupting form
- [ ] **Thank You Page Enhancement**: Add confirmation imagery
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Test Core Web Vitals and image loading performance

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**
- Public domain images from Unsplash/Pexels (no licensing issues)
- Next.js Image component (already available)

**Internal Dependencies**
- Existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Current component patterns and file structure
- Existing deployment pipeline on Vercel

**Technical Dependencies**
- Next.js 14+ framework (✅ already in place)
- Tailwind CSS (✅ already configured)
- TypeScript (✅ already set up)

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks**
- Maintain < 3 second page load time on 3G
- No degradation in Lighthouse performance score
- Image loading should not block critical rendering path

**Quality Gates**
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All images include proper alt text for accessibility
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Graceful fallbacks for missing images

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All 3 pages visually enhanced with appropriate imagery
- Existing RSVP functionality completely preserved
- No new runtime errors or console warnings
- Build process completes successfully

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- Asset collection and optimization: 2-3 days
- Component development: 3-4 days
- Page integration and testing: 2-3 days
- Performance validation and fixes: 1-2 days

**Resource Requirements**
- Single developer (frontend focus)
- No design team involvement required
- No backend/database work needed

**Critical Path Items**
1. Image asset selection and optimization
2. HeroImage component (blocks landing page)
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Mobile responsiveness validation

## Simplification Opportunities

**Leverage Existing Code**
- Use current Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS
- Extend existing component patterns rather than creating new ones
- Build on current responsive design system

**Minimize New Abstractions**
- Keep image components simple and focused
- Avoid complex configuration or theming systems
- Use direct image placement over sophisticated layout systems

**Reuse Current Infrastructure**
- Leverage existing TypeScript interfaces where applicable
- Use current error handling patterns
- Build on existing build and deployment processes
