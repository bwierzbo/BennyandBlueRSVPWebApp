# Task: Server Actions Enhancement

## Description
Extend existing Next.js Server Actions to handle RSVP submissions with guest names, including server-side validation, database persistence, and error handling. Ensure complete form processing pipeline works end-to-end.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server Action processes guest names array correctly
- [ ] Server-side validation using enhanced Zod schemas
- [ ] Guest names stored as JSONB in database
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all validation scenarios
- [ ] Success responses redirect to thank-you page
- [ ] Database transactions handle guest data atomically
- [ ] Performance target: <2 seconds for complete submission

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Enhance existing Server Actions in `lib/actions.ts`
  - Integrate enhanced validation schemas for server-side validation
  - Update database operations to handle guest names JSONB field
  - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
  - Ensure atomic transactions for RSVP and guest data
- **Key considerations**:
  - Guest names array must be properly formatted for JSONB storage
  - Server validation should match client validation exactly
  - Error responses should preserve form state when possible
  - Handle edge cases like empty guest names arrays
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `lib/actions.ts` - Enhanced Server Actions for RSVP submission
  - `lib/db.ts` - Database operations with guest names (if needed)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (database schema with guest names)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (validation schemas for server-side validation)
- [ ] Existing Server Actions from webappframework epic

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside dynamic form UI development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Server Actions handle guest names in form submissions
- [ ] Server-side validation prevents invalid guest data
- [ ] Guest names stored correctly in database JSONB field
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Submission performance meets <2 second target
- [ ] Database operations are atomic and reliable
