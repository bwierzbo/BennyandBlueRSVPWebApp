# Task: Dynamic RSVP Form Implementation

## Description
Implement the dynamic RSVP form with conditional guest name fields, venue disclaimer, and enhanced user experience. Build upon existing form foundation to add guest management UI with real-time validation and responsive design.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RSVP form displays all required fields (name, email, attendance, notes)
- [ ] Guest count field appears only when "attending" is selected
- [ ] Dynamic guest name fields render based on guest count (0-10)
- [ ] Venue age restriction disclaimer shows for attending guests
- [ ] Form validates in real-time with clear error feedback
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design with intuitive UX
- [ ] Progressive enhancement works without JavaScript
- [ ] Form state preservation during validation errors

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Enhance existing `/app/rsvp/page.tsx` with dynamic guest management
  - Use React useState for guest count and names array management
  - Implement conditional rendering for guest fields and disclaimer
  - Integrate enhanced validation schemas with React Hook Form
  - Add venue disclaimer component with conditional visibility
- **Key considerations**:
  - Performance target: <100ms for dynamic field rendering
  - Guest fields should appear/disappear smoothly
  - Form should work progressively without JavaScript
  - Maintain existing design patterns and accessibility
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `/app/rsvp/page.tsx` - Main RSVP form page
  - `components/rsvp-form.tsx` - Enhanced form component
  - `components/ui/` - Any additional UI components needed

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (database schema for guest storage)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (validation schemas for guests)
- [ ] Existing form system from webappframework epic

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (core functionality requiring validation and database support)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dynamic guest fields render based on attendance and count
- [ ] Venue disclaimer appears only for attending guests
- [ ] Form validation works for all guest scenarios
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive design implemented
- [ ] Form performance meets <100ms dynamic rendering target
- [ ] Progressive enhancement functionality verified
