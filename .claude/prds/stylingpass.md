# PRD: stylingpass

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive TailwindCSS styling pass across all core pages of the wedding RSVP application. This initiative will establish a consistent design system, optimize mobile responsiveness, enhance typography and color schemes, and create a cohesive visual experience while building upon the existing decorative layout foundation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis
The wedding RSVP application currently has:
- Basic TailwindCSS implementation with default configuration
- Inconsistent color usage across components (blue-50, blue-600, indigo-100 variations)
- Mixed typography scales and spacing patterns
- Default TailwindCSS variables for backgrounds and gradients
- No centralized design token system
- Opportunity for enhanced mobile optimization

### Why This Is Important Now
1. **Design Consistency**: After the decorativelayout epic, we need to unify the visual experience
2. **User Experience**: Enhanced styling will improve engagement and conversion rates
3. **Maintainability**: A systematic design approach will reduce future development overhead
4. **Professional Appearance**: Wedding guests expect an elegant, polished experience

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Wedding Guests** (Primary)
   - Want an elegant, easy-to-use RSVP experience
   - Expect mobile-first responsive design
   - Desire clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation

2. **Couple (Benny & Blue)** (Secondary)
   - Want their wedding site to reflect their style and personality
   - Need professional appearance for sharing with family/friends
   - Require easy-to-read admin interface for guest management

### User Journeys

**Guest RSVP Journey:**
1. Arrives at landing page → sees elegant hero with clear typography
2. Clicks RSVP button → guided to beautifully styled form
3. Completes form → receives visually appealing confirmation

**Admin Management Journey:**
1. Accesses admin dashboard → clean, professional interface
2. Reviews guest list → well-organized, scannable layout
3. Exports data → clearly styled controls and feedback

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Inconsistent visual experience across pages
- Default browser styling leaking through
- Suboptimal mobile experience in some areas
- Lack of wedding-appropriate color palette
- Missing design system documentation

## Requirements

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Visual Consistency Score**: 95%+ consistent color usage across components
2. **Mobile Usability**: All pages score 90+ on mobile-friendly test
3. **Performance Maintained**: Core Web Vitals scores unchanged or improved
4. **Code Quality**: Zero custom CSS classes added (pure Tailwind approach)

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- **User Engagement**: Time on RSVP page (target: increase 10%)
- **Conversion Rate**: RSVP completion rate (maintain or improve current rate)
- **Performance**: First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- **Accessibility**: Lighthouse accessibility score 95+

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom Tailwind configuration implemented
- [ ] All pages follow consistent design system
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified across devices
- [ ] Form styling enhances user experience
- [ ] Admin interface appears professional
- [ ] No regression in functionality or performance
- [ ] Design tokens documented in code comments

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must use TailwindCSS exclusively (no external UI libraries)
- Cannot modify existing component APIs
- Must maintain all current functionality
- Database integration unchanged

### Timeline Constraints
- Complete within 1-2 development sprints
- No dependencies on external design assets
- Use system fonts only (no Google Fonts integration)

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer implementation
- No external design consultation
- Existing image assets only

### Assumptions
- Current TailwindCSS setup is functional
- Existing component structure is sound
- Performance targets can be maintained
- Users prefer minimal, elegant wedding themes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- TailwindCSS 3.3.0+ (already installed)
- Next.js 15 (existing)
- No new package installations required

### Internal Team Dependencies
- None (self-contained styling work)
- Existing component structure must remain intact
- Database schema unchanged

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- Vercel deployment pipeline unchanged
- Build process compatibility maintained

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
- Custom animations or complex interactions
- Brand-specific logos or custom iconography
- Dark mode implementation (save for future epic)
- Google Fonts integration (system fonts only)
- Complete UI library replacement
- Database or API changes
- New page creation
- Third-party analytics integration

### Future Enhancements (Not This Epic)
- Advanced theming system
- Custom fonts from external sources
- Animation library integration
- Advanced accessibility features beyond basic compliance
- Internationalization (i18n) support

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (TailwindCSS Configuration)
1. Update `tailwind.config.js` with custom design tokens
2. Modify `globals.css` with improved base styles
3. Test configuration across all pages

### Phase 2: Core Pages Styling
1. Landing page refinements
2. RSVP form enhancements
3. Thank you page polish
4. Admin interface improvements

### Phase 3: Mobile Optimization & Testing
1. Responsive design verification
2. Cross-device testing
3. Performance validation
4. Accessibility testing

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup
1. Add design token comments
2. Remove any unused styles
3. Update component documentation
4. Performance final verification

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Performance Regression**: Mitigation → Continuous monitoring during development
- **Mobile Layout Issues**: Mitigation → Test on real devices throughout development

### Medium Risk
- **Color Contrast Issues**: Mitigation → Use accessibility testing tools
- **Component Breaking Changes**: Mitigation → Incremental testing

### Low Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Well-established TailwindCSS patterns
- **Deployment Issues**: No infrastructure changes required

## Technical Architecture

### TailwindCSS Design System Structure
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js enhancement
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'sans': ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
      },
      colors: {
        wedding: {
          dustyPink: { /* custom dusty pink scale */ },
          roseGold: { /* custom rose gold scale */ },
          lavender: { /* custom lavender scale */ }
        }
      },
      spacing: { /* custom spacing scale */ },
      typography: { /* custom typography */ }
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Pattern Examples
```typescript
// Consistent button styling approach
<Button className="bg-wedding-dustyPink-500 hover:bg-wedding-dustyPink-600 text-white">

// Form field styling pattern
<Input className="border-wedding-roseGold-300 focus:border-wedding-dustyPink-500">

// Card styling pattern
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-wedding border border-wedding-lavender-200">
```

### File Structure Impact
```
├── tailwind.config.js (enhanced)
├── app/globals.css (updated base styles)
├── app/page.tsx (refined styling)
├── app/rsvp/page.tsx (enhanced form styling)
├── app/thank-you/page.tsx (polished confirmation)
├── app/admin/guests/page.tsx (professional interface)
└── components/ (consistent styling patterns)
```

This comprehensive styling pass will transform the wedding RSVP application into a visually cohesive, professionally designed, and mobile-optimized experience that reflects the elegance expected for a wedding celebration while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics.
