# PRD: Wedding RSVP Web App Framework

## Executive Summary

A self-hosted, minimal wedding RSVP web application built as a scaffold for rapid deployment. This framework provides a clean, modern full-stack foundation using Next.js 14+ (App Router), PostgreSQL (Neon), and Vercel deployment. The goal is to eliminate repetitive setup and enable immediate focus on RSVP-specific functionality while maintaining professional branding and user experience.

**Value Proposition**: Replace generic RSVP tools (Google Forms, The Knot) with a custom-branded, self-hosted solution that takes 1-2 weeks from scaffold to production-ready.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Wedding RSVP collection is currently fragmented across generic tools that lack customization, branding, and proper data ownership. Existing solutions either:
- Require expensive monthly subscriptions (The Knot, Zola)
- Lack professional appearance (Google Forms)
- Don't integrate with modern development workflows
- Provide no data ownership or export capabilities

### Why is this important now?
- Need immediate solution for personal wedding planning
- Desire full control over guest data and experience
- Want to leverage existing modern tech stack (Next.js, Neon, Vercel)
- Require rapid deployment without starting from scratch

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Ben (Developer/Groom)
**Background**: Experienced full-stack developer comfortable with Next.js, Prisma, Neon, and Vercel deployment workflows.

**User Journey**:
1. Clone/scaffold the framework
2. Configure environment variables for Neon DB
3. Deploy to Vercel with zero configuration
4. Customize branding and copy
5. Share RSVP link with wedding guests
6. Monitor responses via admin interface (future PRD)

**Pain Points Being Addressed**:
- Repetitive project setup for simple web applications
- Need for custom branding and control over user experience
- Desire for clean, modern architecture without bloat
- Time pressure for wedding planning

### Secondary User Persona: Wedding Guests
**Background**: Non-technical users accessing RSVP form via shared link.

**User Journey**:
1. Receive RSVP link from couple
2. Navigate to clean, branded landing page
3. Fill out simple RSVP form
4. Receive confirmation of submission
5. (Optional) Modify response if needed (future feature)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Scaffolding
- **FR-001**: Generate Next.js 14+ project with App Router architecture
- **FR-002**: Include TypeScript configuration and strict type checking
- **FR-003**: Provide organized folder structure: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/types`
- **FR-004**: Include `.env.example` with required Neon DB configuration

#### Database Schema & Integration
- **FR-005**: Define RSVP data model with fields:
  - `id` (UUID primary key)
  - `name` (string, required)
  - `email` (string, required, unique)
  - `isAttending` (boolean, required)
  - `numberOfGuests` (integer, default 1)
  - `notes` (optional text)
  - `createdAt` (timestamp)
  - `updatedAt` (timestamp)
- **FR-006**: Provide Neon DB connection utility in `/lib/db`
- **FR-007**: Include database migration/setup scripts

#### Core Pages & Routing
- **FR-008**: Landing page (`/`) with wedding information and RSVP call-to-action
- **FR-009**: RSVP form page (`/rsvp`) with validation and submission handling
- **FR-010**: Thank you confirmation page (`/thank-you`) post-submission
- **FR-011**: Server Actions or API routes for form submission handling

#### Deployment & Configuration
- **FR-012**: Vercel-ready configuration (`vercel.json`, deployment scripts)
- **FR-013**: Zero-config deployment to Vercel with Neon DB integration
- **FR-014**: README with setup instructions and deployment guide

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Initial page load under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **NFR-002**: Form submission response under 1 second
- **NFR-003**: Lighthouse score >90 for Performance and Accessibility

#### Security
- **NFR-004**: Input validation and sanitization for all form fields
- **NFR-005**: Rate limiting on form submissions (prevent spam)
- **NFR-006**: Secure database connection with environment variable management

#### Scalability
- **NFR-007**: Support up to 500 RSVP submissions without performance degradation
- **NFR-008**: Modular architecture for easy feature additions

#### Browser Support
- **NFR-009**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
- **NFR-010**: Mobile-responsive design for phone and tablet access

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Setup Time**: Developer can go from clone to deployed app in under 30 minutes
2. **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode with zero compilation errors
3. **Performance**: All pages load under 2 seconds on mobile
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during wedding RSVP collection period
5. **User Experience**: <5% form abandonment rate based on analytics

### Key Metrics & KPIs
- **Time to First Deploy**: <30 minutes from scaffold to live URL
- **Form Completion Rate**: >95% of started forms completed
- **Mobile Usage**: Support >80% mobile traffic without issues
- **Error Rate**: <1% failed form submissions

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must use Neon DB (already provisioned and configured)
- Deployment limited to Vercel platform
- No backend server requirements (serverless only)

### Timeline Constraints
- MVP scaffold needed immediately for personal wedding
- Full RSVP functionality needed within 1-2 weeks
- Wedding date provides hard deadline

### Resource Limitations
- Solo developer (Ben) for initial implementation
- Budget constraints favor free/low-cost solutions
- No dedicated DevOps or infrastructure management

### Assumptions
- Guests will primarily access via mobile devices
- Internet connectivity will be reliable for most guests
- ~100-200 expected RSVP responses
- Basic email notifications sufficient (no SMS required initially)

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building (MVP)
- **Admin Dashboard**: Guest management and analytics (future PRD)
- **Email Notifications**: Automated confirmation emails (future PRD)
- **Advanced Styling**: Custom themes and branding (future PRD)
- **Guest Modifications**: Edit/update submitted RSVPs (future PRD)
- **Multi-Event Support**: Multiple wedding events or dates
- **Payment Integration**: Registry or payment collection
- **Social Features**: Guest messaging or photo sharing
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed reporting and insights
- **A/B Testing**: Form optimization experiments
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Neon DB**: PostgreSQL database service (already configured)
- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting platform
- **Next.js**: React framework and ecosystem
- **TypeScript**: Type system and compilation

### Internal Dependencies
- Developer familiarity with Next.js App Router
- Existing Vercel account and deployment access
- Neon DB connection string and credentials

### Potential Blockers
- Neon DB service availability or connection issues
- Vercel deployment limits or billing restrictions
- Next.js version compatibility with chosen packages
