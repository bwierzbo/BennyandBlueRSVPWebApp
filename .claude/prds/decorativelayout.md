## Executive Summary

Transform the wedding RSVP application from a functional form into an inviting, visually appealing wedding experience by introducing strategic decorative images and visual elements. This enhancement will make the site feel like a real wedding invitation while maintaining functionality and performance through Next.js optimized image delivery.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The current RSVP application, while functionally complete, lacks the visual warmth and wedding atmosphere that guests expect when interacting with wedding-related content. It feels more like a generic form than a personalized wedding invitation.

**Why is this important now?**
- Guests' first impression sets the tone for the wedding experience
- Visual elements create emotional connection and excitement
- A well-designed RSVP page reflects the couple's attention to detail
- Placeholder images allow immediate visual improvement without requiring custom photography

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Wedding Guests (Primary Users)**
- Age range: 25-65
- Relationship: Friends, family, colleagues
- Technical comfort: Mixed (basic to advanced)
- Device usage: 60% mobile, 40% desktop
- Context: Viewing invitation link, completing RSVP

**Wedding Couple (Secondary Users)**
- Role: Content owners, brand representatives
- Need: Professional, beautiful presentation of their wedding
- Context: Sharing links, preview experience

### Detailed User Journeys

**Guest RSVP Journey**
1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - User clicks wedding RSVP link from text/email
   - Immediately sees hero image with wedding announcement
   - Feels welcomed and excited about the event
   - Navigates to RSVP form with positive first impression

2. **RSVP Form** (`/rsvp`)
   - User sees decorative banner reinforcing wedding theme
   - Visual elements reduce form anxiety
   - Completes RSVP with enhanced experience

3. **Confirmation** (`/thank-you`)
   - User receives visual confirmation with thank-you imagery
   - Leaves with positive, memorable final impression

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Generic, cold form experience → Warm, personalized invitation feel
- Lack of visual context → Clear wedding theme and atmosphere
- Functional-only interface → Emotionally engaging experience

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Image Infrastructure**
- Implement Next.js Image component for optimized delivery
- Create organized asset structure in `public/images/`
- Support multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Automatic image optimization and lazy loading

**Landing Page Enhancements**
- Full-width hero image with text overlay capability
- Engagement photo display section
- Wedding date/location placeholder text
- Responsive image scaling across devices

**RSVP Page Enhancements**
- Decorative banner image at page top
- Small icon/illustration near form title
- Enhanced visual spacing and breathing room
- Maintained form functionality

**Thank You Page Enhancements**
- Thank-you themed image display
- Confirmation message with visual context
- Consistent styling with other pages

**Component Architecture**
- Reusable image components (`HeroImage`, `PageBanner`, `ImageSection`)
- Consistent image loading states
- Error handling for missing images
- Alt text for accessibility

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Image loading should not impact Core Web Vitals
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- WebP format support with fallbacks
- Maximum image sizes optimized for web delivery

**Accessibility**
- All images include meaningful alt text
- Decorative images marked appropriately
- Text overlays maintain sufficient contrast
- Images don't interfere with keyboard navigation

**Responsiveness**
- Images scale appropriately on mobile devices
- Text overlays remain readable at all screen sizes
- Loading states work across device types

**SEO**
- Optimized image file names and alt text
- Proper image dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Open Graph image meta tags

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Visual Appeal**: User feedback indicates improved first impression
- **Performance**: No degradation in page load times (< 3s initial load)
- **Engagement**: Maintain or improve RSVP completion rates
- **Technical**: Zero accessibility violations related to images
- **Development**: Reusable components for future enhancements

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Page Load Speed: Maintain < 3 seconds on 3G
- Image Optimization: 90%+ optimized delivery
- Mobile Experience: Images render properly on 95%+ devices
- Accessibility Score: Maintain 100% on lighthouse accessibility
- RSVP Completion Rate: No decrease from baseline

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Limited to public domain or placeholder images initially
- No custom photography budget for initial implementation
- Must maintain existing functionality

### Timeline Constraints
- Implementation within 1-2 weeks
- No dependency on professional photography
- Can iterate with real photos later

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer implementation
- No design team involvement initially
- Limited to existing hosting/CDN capabilities

### Assumptions
- Placeholder images acceptable for initial launch
- Next.js Image optimization sufficient for performance needs
- Current hosting can handle additional image assets
- Users expect visual enhancement over pure functionality

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
- Custom photography or professional photo editing
- Advanced animation or interactive elements
- Complete design system overhaul
- Font customization or color palette changes
- Complex responsive design patterns
- User-customizable themes
- Image upload functionality
- Content management system integration
- A/B testing different image variations

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Next.js framework (already in place)
- Public domain image sources (Unsplash, Pexels)
- Image optimization services (built into Next.js)

### Internal Team Dependencies
- Developer availability for implementation
- Approval on placeholder image selection
- Testing across different devices/browsers
- Integration with existing deployment pipeline

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing Next.js 14+ setup
- Tailwind CSS framework (already configured)
- Vercel hosting platform
- Current build and deployment process

## Implementation Notes

### Suggested Placeholder Assets
```
public/images/
├── hero.jpg (1920x1080 - wedding celebration)
├── floral-banner.jpg (1200x300 - decorative header)
├── rsvp-card-icon.png (64x64 - small accent)
├── thank-you-flowers.jpg (800x600 - gratitude theme)
└── engagement.jpg (600x400 - couple photo placeholder)
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Reusable image components
<HeroImage src="/images/hero.jpg" alt="Wedding celebration" overlay="You're Invited" />
<PageBanner src="/images/floral-banner.jpg" alt="Floral decoration" />
<ImageSection src="/images/engagement.jpg" alt="Happy couple" />
```

### Technical Implementation
- Use `next/image` with `priority` prop for above-the-fold images
- Implement placeholder blur data URIs for smooth loading
- Add proper error boundaries for missing images
- Include comprehensive alt text for screen readers

## Risk Mitigation

### Image Loading Failures
- Graceful degradation when images fail to load
- Fallback to styled text elements
- Error logging for missing assets

### Performance Impact
- Implement proper image sizing and formats
- Monitor Core Web Vitals impact
- Use loading="lazy" for below-fold images

### Content Appropriateness
- Review all placeholder images for wedding context
- Ensure cultural sensitivity in image selection
- Plan for easy replacement with actual wedding photos

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- Integration with actual wedding photography
- Seasonal theme variations
- Admin-configurable image management
- Advanced animation and transitions
- Mobile-specific image optimizations

### Scalability
- Component library expansion
- Theme system for different wedding styles
