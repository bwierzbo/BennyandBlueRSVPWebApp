# PRD: RSVP Functionality Implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement the core RSVP submission functionality for the wedding RSVP web application. This builds on the scaffolded Next.js 14+ foundation from PRD #1 and adds dynamic guest management, form validation, and database persistence. The solution will enable wedding guests to submit their attendance response with up to 10 additional guests while enforcing venue age restrictions.

**Value Proposition**: Transform the basic scaffolded application into a fully functional RSVP system that handles guest responses, validates input, and stores data for wedding planning.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The current wedding RSVP application has the basic structure (routes, database, pages) but lacks the core functionality to actually collect and process RSVP submissions. Wedding guests need a user-friendly way to respond to the invitation, specify their guest count, provide guest names, and understand venue restrictions.

### Why is this important now?
- Wedding invitations need to be sent soon with RSVP links
- Guests expect a smooth, intuitive RSVP experience
- Wedding planning requires accurate headcount and guest information
- Venue has specific age restrictions that must be communicated clearly
- Database needs to capture structured data for vendor coordination

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Wedding Guest
**Background**: Wedding invitee who received an RSVP link and needs to respond to the invitation.

**User Journey - Attending Guest**:
1. Clicks RSVP link from wedding invitation
2. Lands on `/rsvp` page with clear form
3. Enters name and email address
4. Selects "Yes" for attendance
5. Specifies number of additional guests (0-10)
6. Enters individual names for each guest
7. Sees venue age restriction disclaimer
8. Optionally adds notes (dietary restrictions, etc.)
9. Submits form successfully
10. Redirected to confirmation page at `/thank-you`

**User Journey - Non-Attending Guest**:
1. Clicks RSVP link from wedding invitation
2. Lands on `/rsvp` page with clear form
3. Enters name and email address
4. Selects "No" for attendance
5. Optionally adds notes (well wishes, etc.)
6. Submits form successfully
7. Redirected to confirmation page at `/thank-you`

**Pain Points Being Addressed**:
- Confusion about guest count and naming requirements
- Unclear venue restrictions leading to inappropriate guest choices
- Complex multi-step processes that cause abandonment
- Technical errors or validation issues during submission

### Secondary User Persona: Wedding Couple (Ben & Blue)
**Background**: Wedding hosts who need to collect accurate RSVP data for planning purposes.

**User Journey**:
1. Shares RSVP link with wedding guests
2. Expects accurate data collection in database
3. Needs clear guest names for seating arrangements
4. Requires compliance with venue age restrictions
5. Wants structured data for vendor coordination

## Requirements

## Technical Architecture

### Form State Management
```typescript
interface RSVPFormData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isAttending: boolean;
  numberOfGuests: number;
  guestNames: string[];
  notes?: string;
}
```

### Database Schema Extension
```sql
ALTER TABLE rsvps ADD COLUMN guest_names JSONB;
-- or
ALTER TABLE rsvps ADD COLUMN guest_names TEXT[];
```

### Server Action Structure
```typescript
async function submitRSVP(formData: FormData): Promise<{
  success: boolean;
  errors?: Record<string, string>;
  redirectUrl?: string;
}>;
```
